🎲 Dice Betting Bot for Telegram (Python)


A feature-rich, modular Dice Betting Bot built in Python, designed to simulate and analyze various dice betting strategies directly via Telegram. This bot allows users to run simulations with customizable parameters, track performance, visualize profit progression, and receive detailed summaries—making it ideal for strategy testing, analysis, and learning.

🚀 Features
🧠 Multiple Betting Strategies
Supports a wide range of strategies via a modular architecture (dice_strategies.py), allowing easy addition or customization.

⚙️ Interactive Simulation Configuration
Step-by-step Telegram interface for configuring simulation parameters like strategy, base bet, chance, multiplier, and max rounds.

📈 Profit Progression Graphs
Real-time simulation graph generation using matplotlib, tracking balance and profit round-by-round.

📊 Detailed Analytics
Tracks win/loss streaks, profit/loss over time, and displays strategy performance with a rich summary.

💬 Telegram Bot Integration
Fully integrated Telegram bot interface with support for commands, inline navigation (Back/Next), and message-based configuration.

🗃️ Simulation History Logging
Keeps track of individual user simulations with round-wise data and result storage.
